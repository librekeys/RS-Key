# third_party — vendored upstream test suites

Two external conformance suites, vendored so the firmware can be validated
without checking out the upstream repos. They are **not** part of RS-Key's
own test suite (`tests/`, `cargo test`) — they are the upstream ecosystems'
own tests, kept runnable against this implementation.

Both directories carry their own licenses, distinct from the repository's own
AGPL-3.0-only. Note the split between each file's **per-file header** (the
operative license for that file) and the **bundled `LICENSE`** (the upstream
repo's top-level license file):

| Directory | Origin | License (per-file headers) | Bundled `LICENSE` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pico-fido-tests/` | [polhenarejos/pico-fido](https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido) `tests/` | **GPL-3.0-only** (headers read "GNU General Public License … version 3") | AGPL-3.0 (pico-fido's repo LICENSE) |
| `openpgp-card-tests/` | [polhenarejos/pico-openpgp](https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-openpgp) `tests/`, derived from [Gnuk](https://www.fsij.org/gnuk/) (NIIBE Yutaka / g10 Code GmbH) | **GPL-3.0-or-later** (Gnuk headers: "either version 3 … or any later version") | AGPL-3.0 |

These suites are **run-only** (pytest/pyscard) — they are never compiled or
linked into the firmware, and every upstream header is preserved verbatim, so
the GPL/AGPL split above does not interact with RS-Key's own AGPL-3.0-only
build.

Local modifications are minimal and marked in-place; the notable one:
`pico-fido-tests/conftest.py` filters the relying-party's allowed algorithms
to those the installed python-fido2 can actually verify (the firmware can
lead with ML-DSA-44, which older fido2 libraries parse but cannot check).

## Running them

Flash the **no-touch test build** first (the suites cannot press the
button); if your board enforces secure boot, sign it
([docs/production.md](../docs/production.md)).

```sh
# FIDO suite (pytest + python-fido2):
nix develop -c python -m pytest third_party/pico-fido-tests/pico-fido -v

# OpenPGP card suite (pytest + pyscard) — DESTRUCTIVE: resets the card,
# exercises factory PINs/KDF setup. Run section by section:
nix develop -c python -m pytest third_party/openpgp-card-tests/020_kdffull -v
```

Read a suite's conftest before running it: parts are destructive
(authenticator resets, card terminate/activate cycles) and assume factory
default PINs.
