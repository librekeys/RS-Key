# Changelog

All notable changes to RS-Key are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and **releases** are
versioned with [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

Two other version numbers live in the firmware and are deliberately **not** this
tag: the USB `bcdDevice` build counter (bumped on every behavior change), and
`FW_VERSION` — the YubiKey-compatibility version reported to host tools (5.7.4).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-13

First public release — an open-source security-key firmware for the Raspberry Pi
RP2350 (Cortex-M33), a behavioral reimplementation of the AGPL-3.0 pico-keys
family that keeps the "enterprise" features in the open tree.

### Security keys / protocols

- **FIDO2 / WebAuthn / U2F** — passkeys (discoverable credentials), second-factor,
  `ssh -t ed25519-sk`, hmac-secret and largeBlobs; user presence gated on the
  BOOTSEL button (the default touch build).
- **OpenPGP card 3.4** — sign / decrypt / authenticate; EC (Ed25519, NIST, brainpool)
  and on-card RSA keygen (2048/3072/4096) accelerated across both cores.
- **PIV** — X.509 slots, attestation, the Yubico management extensions; works
  through PKCS#11 / OpenSC and the OS-native stacks.
- **OATH (YKOATH)** — TOTP / HOTP credential store.
- **Yubico OTP** — slot programming and challenge-response over CCID, plus the
  HID-keyboard typing path.

### Enterprise features, in the open tree

- forceChangePin enforcement, a SHA-256-chained signed audit trail, an opt-in
  `fips-profile`, organizational attestation (import key + chain), and host-side
  fleet inventory / verification / offboarding tooling.

### Hardening

- Secure boot + anti-rollback (RP2350 OTP), keys sealed under an OTP-burned
  device root, and an at-rest soft-lock of the FIDO seed.

### Tooling

- The `rsk` CLI and the `rsk-tui` ratatui dashboard; guided primary + backup
  device pairing; secure-boot key-rotation tooling. Run without the dev shell via
  `nix run .#rsk`, `.#rsk-tui`, and a one-command flasher `.#flash`.

### USB identity

- The default build presents this project's **own** pid.codes identity
  (`0x1209:0x0001`, "RS-Key Security Key") — not a YubiKey masquerade. An opt-in
  `VIDPID=Yubikey5` flavor borrows the YubiKey identity for `ykman` / Yubico
  Authenticator interop.

### Assurance

- 39 fuzz targets, Kani proofs, a Miri pass, power-cut torture, bit-reproducible
  `nix build` images (per platform, per `flake.lock`), and a hardware-verified
  interop matrix ([docs/interop.md](docs/interop.md)).

### Release artifacts

- Eight firmware flavors (`up-button` × `advertise-pqc` × `fips-profile`), each a
  reproducible **unsigned** `.uf2` — on a secure-boot device, seal it with your
  own key before flashing (`nix run .#flash`, or see
  [docs/production.md](docs/production.md)).
- `SHA256SUMS` over every artifact, a keyless [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/)
  signature of it, and a CycloneDX SBOM. See
  [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md) to verify a download.
