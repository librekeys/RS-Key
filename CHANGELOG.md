# Changelog

All notable changes to RS-Key are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and **releases** are
versioned with [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

Two other version numbers live in the firmware and are deliberately **not** this
tag: the USB `bcdDevice` build counter (bumped on every behavior change), and
`FW_VERSION` — the YubiKey-compatibility version reported to host tools (5.7.4).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-15

The cycle since 0.1.0. USB `bcdDevice` is now `0x0760` (incremented once per
firmware change along the way).

### Added

- **Own AAGUID + FIDO Metadata Statement.** The authenticator reports its own
  model identity (`2479c7bf-6b30-5683-9ec8-0e8171a918b7`, a reproducible UUIDv5)
  instead of the inherited pico-fido one, and ships a self-published FIDO
  Metadata Statement (`metadata/rs-key.metadata.json`) with a drift guard.
- **Supply-chain provenance.** Releases now carry SLSA build provenance
  (slsa-github-generator, keyless) and pass a release-time reproducibility gate
  that rebuilds all eight flavors bit-identical before anything is published.
- **Dependency review.** A `cargo-vet` gate (Mozilla / Google / ISRG / Zcash
  audits + recorded exemptions) blocks new unreviewed crates; a new
  `docs/supply-chain.md` documents the whole chain.
- **Versioned documentation site** — `main`, `develop` and tagged versions are
  published side by side with a switcher.
- **Kani proofs** that the OpenPGP import (BER) parser is panic-free and
  terminating, plus a CI guard that `flake.lock` stays in sync with `flake.nix`.

### Changed

- Every GitHub Action is pinned to a commit SHA, kept fresh by Dependabot.
- The physical-attack posture docs are reframed around the published RP2350
  hacking challenges (threat model / OTP fuses / limitations).

### Fixed

- **U2F routing.** A vendor-AID SELECT over CTAPHID_MSG no longer leaves a sticky
  applet selection that routed later U2F REGISTER / AUTHENTICATE / VERSION into
  `0x6D00`; the MSG selection is dropped on every CTAPHID_INIT.
- **OATH performance.** RESET / LIST / CALCULATE-ALL / lookup probed all 255
  credential slots, and each absent slot rescanned flash; they now touch only
  present credentials — OATH RESET dropped from ~39 s to ~0.5 s.
- **USB transport wedge.** Bounding the CTAPHID/CCID IN-endpoint writes stops an
  abandoned transaction from wedging the interface until a replug.
- The OpenPGP card-status self-test now follows GET DATA response chaining.

### Security

- **Constant-time audit fixes** — RSA base blinding on the raw path and
  constant-time OTP access-code comparisons (`docs/ct-audit.md`).
- **Fault-injection fences** on the PIN and secure-boot gates, so a glitched
  single comparison can't skip the check.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-13

First public release — an open-source security-key firmware for the Raspberry Pi
RP2350 (Cortex-M33), a behavioral reimplementation of the AGPL-3.0 pico-keys
family that keeps the "enterprise" features in the open tree.

### Security keys / protocols

- **FIDO2 / WebAuthn / U2F** — passkeys (discoverable credentials), second-factor,
  `ssh -t ed25519-sk`, hmac-secret and largeBlobs; user presence gated on the
  BOOTSEL button (the default touch build).
- **OpenPGP card 3.4** — sign / decrypt / authenticate; EC (Ed25519, NIST, brainpool)
  and on-card RSA keygen (2048/3072/4096) accelerated across both cores.
- **PIV** — X.509 slots, attestation, the Yubico management extensions; works
  through PKCS#11 / OpenSC and the OS-native stacks.
- **OATH (YKOATH)** — TOTP / HOTP credential store.
- **Yubico OTP** — slot programming and challenge-response over CCID, plus the
  HID-keyboard typing path.

### Enterprise features, in the open tree

- forceChangePin enforcement, a SHA-256-chained signed audit trail, an opt-in
  `fips-profile`, organizational attestation (import key + chain), and host-side
  fleet inventory / verification / offboarding tooling.

### Hardening

- Secure boot + anti-rollback (RP2350 OTP), keys sealed under an OTP-burned
  device root, and an at-rest soft-lock of the FIDO seed.

### Tooling

- The `rsk` CLI and the `rsk-tui` ratatui dashboard; guided primary + backup
  device pairing; secure-boot key-rotation tooling. Run without the dev shell via
  `nix run .#rsk`, `.#rsk-tui`, and a one-command flasher `.#flash`.

### USB identity

- The default build presents this project's **own** pid.codes identity
  (`0x1209:0x0001`, "RS-Key Security Key") — not a YubiKey masquerade. An opt-in
  `VIDPID=Yubikey5` flavor borrows the YubiKey identity for `ykman` / Yubico
  Authenticator interop.

### Assurance

- 39 fuzz targets, Kani proofs, a Miri pass, power-cut torture, bit-reproducible
  `nix build` images (per platform, per `flake.lock`), and a hardware-verified
  interop matrix ([docs/interop.md](docs/interop.md)).

### Release artifacts

- Eight firmware flavors (`up-button` × `advertise-pqc` × `fips-profile`), each a
  reproducible **unsigned** `.uf2` — on a secure-boot device, seal it with your
  own key before flashing (`nix run .#flash`, or see
  [docs/production.md](docs/production.md)).
- `SHA256SUMS` over every artifact, a keyless [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/)
  signature of it, and a CycloneDX SBOM. See
  [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md) to verify a download.
